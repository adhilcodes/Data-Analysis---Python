The Material is designed for a learning camp at [TinkerHub Foundation](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org) on Data Analysis using Python.

## Pre-requisites 

 - Python Basics 
 - We need the students to have  a prior knowledge of Python at least an intermediate level. 
 - For refreshing and brushing up your Python skills weâ€™ll be sharing few resources before the session starts.
 - Basic experience with Google colab (optional) / Jupyter notebook or any other Python IDE  for coding during the session and for submitting assignment.
